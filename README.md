# 8-Puzzle Solver

## Project Description
This project is an implementation of the classic 8-puzzle game solver using AI techniques. It includes a random puzzle generator, solvability check, and a goal state verification module to solve the 8-puzzle efficiently using heuristic algorithms.

### Features
- **Random Puzzle Generator:** Generates random 8-puzzle configurations.
- **Solvability Check:** Ensures that the generated puzzles can be solved.
- **Goal State Verification:** Checks if the current state is the goal state.
- **Heuristic Algorithms:** NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
